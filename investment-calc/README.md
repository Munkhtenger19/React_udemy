# Components
same functionality as Angular, reusable, should start with capital letter
## Props
can pass props (attributes) to a component which is similar to a function
``<User 
    name="me"
    age={25} // use {} if pass it as a number
    details={{games:"GTA"}} //object
    hobbies={['hhi', 'what']} //array
/> ``
